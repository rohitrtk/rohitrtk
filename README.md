### Hi ✌️

My name's Rohit, I'm a student at the University of Toronto Mississauga campus currently majoring in Mathematics and doing a double minor in Computer Science and Philosophy.

##

#### What I'm doing?
I currently work for [Six Nations Polytechnic](https://www.snpolytechnic.com/) as a Senior Software Developer Intern. We're currently experimenting with a VR experience using JavaScript and AFrame.

Lately, I've been monkeying around with React, trying to build some basic web pages. I also have an interest in graphics programming, so I've been slowly, but surely, trying to learn OpenGL.

#### Here are the technologies I'm currently using

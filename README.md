# \<RohitKisto />
My name's Rohit, I'm an Application Developer at Kenna, and gradute of the University of Toronto Mississauga. My day job has me primarily using web technologies such as React, Next.js, SCSS, and SQL Server. However, for my personal projects I use a variety of technologies such as C++, TypeScript, OpenGL, Tailwind, and PostgreSQL just to name a few. When I'm not programming, you can find me playing guitar, doing math, and lifting weights.

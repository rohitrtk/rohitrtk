### Hi ✌️

My name's Rohit, I'm a student at the University of Toronto Mississauga campus currently majoring in Mathematics and doing a double minor in Computer Science and Philosophy.

##

#### What I'm doing?
I currently work for [Six Nations Polytechnic](https://www.snpolytechnic.com/) as a Senior Software Developer Intern. We recently completed an XR project to help people learn about indigenous culture, as well as allow other people to create experiences for themselves. Right now, we're currently working on a web form system to allow parents , who have children at SNP, to view what classes their kids are taking, when they have assignments due, etc.

In my spare time, I've been learning OpenGL and making a beyond primitive game engine in C++. I've also been poking around PHP as it's a language I'm not all too familiar with, but I find it amazing because of how much you can actually do with it on the web.
